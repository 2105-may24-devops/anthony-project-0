Data Zero

A program that automates the boring part of the data pipeline -- getting the data.

MVPs - Minimum Viable Product
	- checks a url for its permissions for user-agents
	- looks for tabular data on given site
	- downloads it into csv, and/or excel files
	- file browser
	- GUI simple

NTHs - Nice to haves
	- GUI
	- Tag-System for easy searching
	- Analysis shortcuts (like opening files, with preloaded code to a jupyter notebook,
	- so you can jump into the data cleaning, and analysis.)
